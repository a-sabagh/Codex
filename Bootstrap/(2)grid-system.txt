Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page.
    xs (for phones)
    sm (for tablets)
    md (for desktops)
    lg (for larger desktops)
First; create a row (<div class="row">). Then, add the desired number of columns (tags with appropriate .col-*-* classes). Note that numbers in .col-*-* should always add up to 12 for each row.
